# Abstract

### Introduction
Video gaming is a very popular activity used for leisure, across the world. A popular conception about video games is that they aren't good, psychologically speaking; this is however an orthodoxed ideology and this research paper is set out to prove it wrong. **Why is this important?** To give a contradictory view -- supported with data and analysis -- to a matter that lets people thoroughly understand exactly what is going on, and form their own opinions instead of either living in the dark or just accpeting the popular opinion without any research of their own. 


### Method
To prove the point, the programming language *Python* is being used for machine learning by analysing a dataset given in the .csv format. Numerous *Python* libraries are being used to complement this work: *Pandas*, *SciKit*, and *Numpy* to name a few. 

### Results
Using these tools, a model can be created that predicts (using mathematics and statistics) that helps predict the threshold at which video gaming becomes bad, not that video games inherently are a waste of time and energy.

### Analysis
Gaming doesn't really have a negative effect on people's lives. Only playing above *x* amount of hours can pose to be harmful, and less than *y*% of gamers play more than this threshold.

### Discussion
In order to reduce the amount of hours spent on gaming, there are some changes in lifestyle that you can make. Such as:

+ x
+ y
+ z
